## Conclusion

This project plan provides a structured approach to developing AIForge over two 4-week phases. Phase 1 focuses on building the foundation and core components, while Phase 2 emphasizes advanced features, scalability, and integration. The plan incorporates an AI-based documentation strategy, focusing on high-quality markdown files, extensive documentation, and schematics that can be easily explored and updated.

Throughout the development process, regular code reviews, testing, and documentation updates should be conducted to ensure high-quality, maintainable code. The AI-based documentation system will evolve alongside the project, providing an innovative and flexible way to explore and understand the AIForge toolkit.

The plan remains flexible and can be adjusted based on progress and emerging priorities. Regular team meetings and progress assessments will help keep the project on track and allow for necessary adjustments to the timeline or scope.
